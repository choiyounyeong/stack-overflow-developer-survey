## Final Project: Stack Overflow Developer Analysis

### Project Summary

This project analyzes annual pay of developers based on various factors using decision tree regression and LightGBM models to predict annual pay and determine which factors have the most impact.

### Motivation:
As an enthusiastic learner of programming, I have always wondered which factors most influence a developer's annual pay. This analysis aims to illuminate these factors, providing insights that could help developers and engineers make informed decisions about their career paths.

### Goal of Analysis:
The primary goal of this analysis is to identify the key factors that influence the annual pay of developers as reported in the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey. I will employ various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to predict annual pay based on variables such as education level, programming languages known, years of experience, and geographic location. This will not only help individuals assess their potential earnings but also guide them in enhancing their skills and qualifications for better compensation.

### Data Source:
The dataset for this analysis is gathered from [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/)

It is available to the public as a .csv file, and I recommend accessing the page to investigate further by yourself. The size of the original dataset is 158.6 MB, it includes 89,184 rows from approximately 90,000 developers worldwide, and provides a rich basis for our analysis with 84 columns.
